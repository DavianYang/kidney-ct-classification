# Kidney Stone CT Classification

Deep learning-based classification of kidney CT images for university thesis research.

## 🎯 Overview

This project implements a research-grade PyTorch pipeline for classifying kidney CT images into four categories:

- Normal
- Stone
- Cyst
- Tumor

**Key Features:**

- Patient-wise data splitting (prevents data leakage)
- Class imbalance handling with weighted loss
- Multiple CNN architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet, ViT)
- Kaggle-ready notebooks
